# **Privacy-Aware Personalized ADAS Research**
UCI undergraduate research project exploring personalized Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) that are privacy-aware and adaptive based on various human states. <br/>

## Information:

This repository mainly includes code written in Python and used with CARLA Simulator, an open-source driving simulation environment. The CARLA Python API files (for CARLA 0.9.5) are also included in order to make this code run on a CARLA build. They are located in the **carla** directory.

The primary objective up until now has been the Lane Departure Warning sensor. Relevant code is in the directory of the same name. In the future, different objectives of this project will be placed in different directories in this repository.
