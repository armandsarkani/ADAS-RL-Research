    "\n",
    "In the previous part we implemented a player that uses a table to learn the Q function. This worked quite well. In particular because Tic Tac Toe only has very few states and each state only has very few possible moves. For a more complicated game, such as Go or Chess, the tabular approach would not be feasible. \n",
    "\n",
    "What, if we could write a program that mimics the behavior of the Q function without actually having to store the exact value for every state and action? Obviously, after a bit of practice, humans are able to spot certain patterns in the game position and deduce general rules of how to react to them. Can we teach a program to do something similar?\n",

    "1. Classify the input: E.g. if the input is a picture, the output could be what kind of animal is in the picture.\n",
    "2. Mimic a complex function (also called regression): Given an input value for the complex function, correctly predict what the output would be. \n",

In particular you will have to install all kinds of GPU libraries before you can install TensorFlow. Only do so if you are comfortable with complex software installations and if you are able to deal with the messy fallout that inevitably happens if you get stuck in the middle of the process and have to roll back what you have done so far. Should you succeed, however, the code in this and the following notebooks will run noticeably fast than without GPU support. "

    "## A short introduction to Artificial Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Neural Networks are made up of *Nodes*. A *Node* takes 1 or more inputs. It combines the inputs linearly, i.e. it multiplies each input $i_x$ with a dedicated weight $w_x$ for that input and adds them all up. On top of that it adds another value, the so called *bias*. It then applies an activation function $f_a$ to the result and sends it to one or more outputs $O$:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Title](./Images/NN_Node.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "Side Note: The *bias* effectively turns the linear function of the node into an affine linear function, i.e. a line that does not necessarily run through the point $(0,0)$. Without that, no matter what the trained weights say, the output to input $0$ would always be $0$. There are other ways to achieve that, and indeed you will find them in some books. E.g. by adding another input to every node with the fixed input value of 1. Mathematically this is just the same.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The activation function allows us to achieve non-linearity. Without it we would only be able to mimic linear functions. Also, without it, multi-layer networks would not make any sense. They would just be a combination of linear functions and as any Algebra textbook would tell us: a combination of linear function is no more than a linear function itself. I.e. we could just collapse all layers into one and do the whole computation more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes that have no connections coming in are called *Input Nodes* and nodes having no connections coming out are called *Output Nodes*. Nodes are arranged in layers, with the first layer consisting of Input Nodes and the last layer consisting of Output Nodes. The other layers are also often referred to as *Hidden Layers* as the user will only ever interact with the Input and Output layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple network with one hidden layer may look like this (source [Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Colored_neural_network.svg/300px-Colored_neural_network.svg.png)):\n",

    "\n",
    "By setting the weights in the nodes *just right* the neural network can mimic other complex functions with the same number of input and output values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The special things about an artificial neural network is, that it can be trained to learn those weights and biases. By giving the Neural Network feedback on how good its output was, it can adjust its weights and biases in a process called *Gradient Descent*. For networks with more than one hidden layer it also uses a process called *Back-propagation* to apply the gradient layers that are further away from the output layer. \n",

    "\n",
    "To train a Neural Network to play Tic Tac Toe, we need to define the following things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Topology of the network, i.e. how do the input and output layers look like. How many hidden layers and how big?\n",
    "* A *loss function*. The loss function will take the output of the Neural Network and return a value indicating how good that output was.\n",
    "* A training part which will try to adjust the weights in the Neural Network as to minimize the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The basic Tic Tac Toe Q learning Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "We will experiment with some different graphs, but the basic shape will always be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An input layer which takes a game state, i.e. the current board, as input. \n",
    "* One or more hidden layer.\n",
    "* An output layer which will ouput the Q value for all possible moves in that game state.\n",
    "* As loss function we will use [Mean Squared Error](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/losses/mean_squared_error) which is a generic and popular loss function for regression, i.e. learning to mimic another function. \n",
    "* The input for the loss function will be the output of the Neural Network and our updated estimate of the Q function by applying the discounted reward. I.e. the loss will be the difference between the output of the Neural Network and our estimate of the Q function after applying the discounted reward.\n",
    "* We will mostly use the [Gradient Descent Optimizer](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/GradientDescentOptimizer) for training - i.e. to adjust the weights in the Neural Network. There are other reasonable, or potentially even better, options as well. Feel free to experiment - report back how it went.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "There are many different other ways how we could do this:<br/>\n",
    "We could feed an action into the network together with the board state, and have a single output value indicating the value of this action. <br/>\n",
    "We could also just have single output value encoding the value of the state and use that as a proxy for the State / Action pairs that lead to that state.<br/>\n",
    "And many more.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The input layer\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also many options how we can encode the input to the Neural Network. We could just have a single node and feed the unique hash value of the the board into it. Or we could feed an array into it with each element encoding the value of the piece on it. Conventional wisdom however seems to be that Neural Networks work best in cases like this with binary arrays as input. Blindly trusting this advice, our input will be an array of 27 (= 3 * 9) bits with the first 9 bits set to 1 at the positions of the crosses, the next 9 bits set to 1 at the position of the Naughts - or the other way round, I forgot which way it was -, and the final 9 bits set to 1 at the empty positions. \n",

    "\n",
    "### The output layer\n",
    "\n",
    "The output layer will have 9 nodes / output values, one for each position of the board that we could play. We will interpret the value of a node as the Q value of the corresponding move. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be ignoring the fact that for a particular board state some position would already be taken and no longer an option. The player will deal with this when choosing a move and ignore illegal moves no matter what their Q values are. That is, we do not try to teach the Neural Network what moves are legal or not. Again, general advice you find is that this is the better approach - we have to be careful though to also ignore these moves when computing $$max_a Q(S', a)$$ for the Q Value update."
