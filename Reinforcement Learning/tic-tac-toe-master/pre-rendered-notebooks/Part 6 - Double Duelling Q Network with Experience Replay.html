<h1 id="Double-Duelling-Q-Network-with-Experience-Replay">Double Duelling Q Network with Experience Replay<a class="anchor-link" href="#Double-Duelling-Q-Network-with-Experience-Replay">&#182;</a></h1><p>In the previous part we discoverded that just being a bit less greedy in our action policy was not enough. It may or may not have helped a bit in some cases, but it certainly didn't solve the problem.</p>
<p>Maybe it's time to look at more sophisticated network topologies. Let's look at what the epxerts do for some guidance: For me this means this excellent blog post by Arthur Juliani: <a href="https://medium.com/@awjuliani/simple-reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-part-4-deep-q-networks-and-beyond-8438a3e2b8df">Simple Reinforcement Learning with Tensorflow Part 4: Deep Q-Networks and Beyond</a>.</p>
<p>I encourage you to read the article yourself, but here is a summary of what he does there that we currently don't:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convolutional Layers</li>
<li>Experience Replay</li>
<li>Pre-training games</li>
<li>Separate Target Network (Double Q Network)</li>
<li>Duelling Q Network</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Convolutional-Layers">Convolutional Layers<a class="anchor-link" href="#Convolutional-Layers">&#182;</a></h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">Convolutional network layers</a> are very powerful for processing and analysing visual images as they process and idnentify patterns in stacks of 2D input data arrays - generally different colour bands of 2D raster images.</p>
<p>Given the inherent 2D nature of a Tic Tac Toe board, this might help quite a lot.</p>
<h2 id="Experience-Replay">Experience Replay<a class="anchor-link" href="#Experience-Replay">&#182;</a></h2><p>By storing previous games in an experience buffer and reuse this past experience when training the network we can increase the stability of the training. We avoid the network getting stuck in patterns where it keeps playing the same bad moves over and over again with little change to outcomes or learning. In particular, my hope is that this will help us in cases where positive experiences are very rare, e.g. playing second against the Min Max Player.</p>
<h2 id="Pre-training-games">Pre-training games<a class="anchor-link" href="#Pre-training-games">&#182;</a></h2><p>This is a set of games where we chose moves completely randomly. This gives us a reasonably broad experience and sample of possible outcomes. If we start directly with a network based move policy we have the risk that random weight initialization creates a policy which is stuck in a local minimum and very unlikely to allow us to explore a wide set of actions - even using a $\epsilon$-greedy strategy.</p>
<h2 id="Separate-Target-Network">Separate Target Network<a class="anchor-link" href="#Separate-Target-Network">&#182;</a></h2><p>According to the experts, using the same Q-Network for a training as well as the target Q function for computing the loss can become unstable and spiral out of control. By separating the target into an independent second network,  training should  become more stable.</p>
<p>Our current toplogy looks like this, with the current state being $s$, the state after move $a$ being $s'$, the reward of the current move being $r$, and the discount value for future expected rewards being $\gamma$:</p>
<p><img src="./Images/SingleQNet.PNG" alt="Title"></p>
<p>After adding a target network it will look like this:</p>
<p><img src="./Images/DoubleQNet.PNG" alt="Title"></p>
<p>Every now and then we update the target network by copying the weights from the main network to it.</p>
<h2 id="Duelling-Q-Network">Duelling Q Network<a class="anchor-link" href="#Duelling-Q-Network">&#182;</a></h2><p>Currently the network will produce an absolute quality value for every move. A potential improvement over this approach is to put the value of a move in relation to the value of the current board state. I.e. rather than looking at the absolute Q value of a move we ask how much does a move improve or decrease the value of the current board state. Or in other words: How much better or worse is a move compared to the other possible moves in this state. We call this the <em>Advantage</em> of the move. I.e.</p>
<p>$$Q(s,a) = V(s) + A(a)$$</p>
<p>where $Q(s,a)$ is the Q value of move $a$ in state $s$, $V(s)$ is the Q value of state $s$, and $A(a)$ is the Advantage of move $a$.</p>
<p>The Duelling Q Network would look like this:</p>
<p><img src="./Images/DuellingQNet.PNG" alt="Title"></p>
<h2 id="Putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together<a class="anchor-link" href="#Putting-it-all-together">&#182;</a></h2><p>If we wanted to be methodical about this, we should try each of those potential improvements independently and see if and how much they actually improve things. Then all combinations. Nobody has time for that, so we add Experience Replay, Pre Training games, a separate target network, and the Duelling Q Network topology all at once. We don't quite do Convolutional Layers yet, however. The code for this is in <a href="https://github.com/fcarsten/tic-tac-toe/blob/master/tic_tac_toe/ExpDoubleDuelQPlayer.py">ExpDoubleDuelQPlayer</a>.</p>
<p>Let's take it for a spin:</p>
<p>First, the easy case - Going first against the RandomPlayer.</p>
