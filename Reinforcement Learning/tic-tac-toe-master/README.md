# Tic Tac Toe 
## A tale about trying to train a machine to play Tic Tac Toe through Reinforcement Learning

To run the Jupyter notebooks in Binder press:  [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fcarsten/tic-tac-toe/master)

The goal of this series is to implement and test a couple of different approaches to 
training a computer how to play **Tic Tac Toe**. We will create:

* A player that plays completely randomly, 
* Two players that implement simple forms of the Min-Max algorithm, 
* Several players that we will train through Reinforcement Learning:
    * a Tabular Q-Learning player.
    * a Simple Neural Network Q-Learning player.
    * a Deep Neural Network Q-learning player.
    * a Policy Gradient Descent based player.

I assume you are familiar with:
* The rules and basic strategy of playing Tic Tac Toe.
* Basic Python 3 programming and use of a Python IDE or Jupyter Notebooks.
* At least rudimentary knowledge of Tensorflow and Neural Networks would be helpful, but you might be able to do 
without (give it a try and if it's too overwhelming do some of the beginner tutorials, 
and then try again).
